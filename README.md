# Language-Technology
As part of my Master's course "Digital Media and Artificial Intelligence" I transformed and ran a [code](Machine_translation_Fragkouli_Taskoudis.py) in python, which includes a neural network (LSTM RNN) for the purpose of translating texts from [German-to-English](Language Technology/deu-eng.zip).
The library used by the code is Keras and the score to measure the performance of the model is Blue.
A [text](Presentation_Fragkouli_Taskoudis.pdf) in paper format was also written with all the information regarding the work (theory, data preparation, analysis of results and conclusions).
